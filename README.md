## General info
I created a tool for visualizing text data in 2D/3D, allowing you to draw graphs, create approximations, calculate integrals, and calculate the area of a spatial figure.

## Technologies Used
Project is created with:
* Python version: 3.10
* Numpy version: 2.2.3
* Matplotlib version: 3.10.1
* Scipy version: 1.15.2
* PyCharm Community Edition

## Setup
To run this project, create new empty project in PyCharm editor, copy all files and put command below in PyCharm terminal:
```
pip install -r .\requirements.txt
```

## How to run app
Run app and choose one number between 1 and 9 from app console menu

## Project Status
Project is complete. I currently have no plans to further develop the game, as I have achieved the intended learning outcomes
